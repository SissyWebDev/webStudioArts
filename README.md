## About

I truly love supporting dreamers on their quest -- 
How can we co-create a digital presence that supports your vision?
20+ years of design in service of solutions can be found in the examples here.
Accessibility is always my goal; kindness over commerce.
Work for pleasure or money are both work; let's find a healthy boundary between the two and meet there.
